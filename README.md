# SCNwithBlockchain

The objective of this project is to construct a Supply Chain Network (SCN) secured with Blockchain and:
  1. To find the optimum route from a manufacturer to customer
  2. To trace back the origin of a product

A supply chain network is used to simulate the behaviour of logistics over time. With an effective supply chain management, organisations can plan their operations well in advance in order to reduce costs and enhance profits. This discipline has been gaining importance in recent years because of increased competition as a result of globalisation. A supply chain usually consists of manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers.

A problem with an existing supply chain is that data may be isolated with suppliers and procurement officers, who might even tamper with it. Thus it is highly essential to decentralise the control and secure it with a blockchain. A blockchain is defined as a time-stamped series of immutable records of data, being managed by a cluster of computers instead of a single entity. Being transparent, a blockchain makes it easier to trace a productâ€™s journey to its point of origin.

The average throughput of our blockchain over 10 simulations was found out to be 360,620 transactions per second.
